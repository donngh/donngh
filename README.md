Hello, i'm Donnatien 

I'm a software developer.

I like football, chess, reading.

I am interested in everything related to the interaction between people.
It's important to keep a good relationship with everyone.
That's why I spend time on

Here is a little funny storytelling: 
When I was new to programming, the funny thing I did was to confuse C and C #, and even C ++.  
I had read C # docs in advance while the course was on C in class. :p 
It was a beautiful memory for me :)
